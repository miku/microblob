In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed.

A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown.

As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.  Comment: 60 LaTeX pages.

In this scenario, the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy.

The study and classification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we consider {\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result.

From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.

These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein.

Lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible.   RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.   The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.

Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition, it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering coefficient in a network.

To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (\u003e 2 eV) appears at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials. This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based technology.

Local nano-friction experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure in the friction test remains low (\u003c0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction coefficient is high ($\\mu$ \u003e 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 \u003c $\\mu$ \u003c 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm. This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a discrete kinetic theory which yields \\textit{exactly} the fluid equations, i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \\textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}). The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations \\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial compressibility method are discussed.

Numerical calculations for the transition rates are performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels. Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.

In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene, 1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results, some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6 aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.

The primary aim is to establish some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient numbers with spatial positions near $-\\gamma t$ and type positions near $\\kappa \\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.

This includes analogs to all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations \u003c 0.5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap.

The algorithm is tested for a hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within experimental error should be observed.

We present a new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future. A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5 {\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.

We determine the H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs, which is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1, suggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these redshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines and about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor Galaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations. The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06 (6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent with the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest that galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z \u003c 1.

A neural circuit can be thought of as a directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse. It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined. The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance to hemodynamics has been outlined.

The piston separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\\geq 1$. Using averaging techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $ when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.   When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged behavior is $\\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly, both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.   In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging results.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail.

We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be intensively used for applications. ","authors":[{"rft.au":"Shelkovich, V.

Here we give a simple proof of those overlooked results.   Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently that this is not clear.

The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems.

It is shown that for p = 2 the algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.

The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of overlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels have been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and error detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors oc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the hierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The models have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for system-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject faults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and recovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault models are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk failures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the disks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given submodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the lower-level submodel.

We find a size-dependent cumulative advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations. In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance universities.

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted, and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the unsynchronizable state.

We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches. In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear methods is further required.

Here we show how a slight variant in the proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level of the starting state.

We present the preliminary results of a project aimed at studying the evolutionary properties and distance of the stellar populations in external galaxies based on the SBF method.   On the observational side, we have succeeded in detecting I-band SBF gradients in six bright ellipticals imaged with the ACS, for these same objects we are now presenting also B-band SBF data. These B-band data are the first fluctuations magnitude measurements for galaxies beyond 10 Mpc.   To analyze the properties of stellar populations from the data, accurate SBF models are essential. As a part of this project, we have evaluated SBF magnitudes from Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models specifically optimized for the purpose. A wide range of chemical compositions and ages, as well as different choices of the photometric system have been investigated.

With increasing environmental dielectric constant ($\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\\epsilon_{\\rm env} \\sim 5$ without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron interaction. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$, $E_{\\rm ii} = E_{\\rm ii}^{\\infty} + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env}^{-\\alpha}$. We also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\\bf 3}, 1235 (2003)], are close to those of $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ of 2. However, in addition to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that the ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the uniaxial-stress-induced shift.

Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m \u003c\u003c n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented.

The complexity of the height fluctuation of surfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of surface features. We have found that there is a phase transition at around 400$^oC$ from one set to two sets of roughness parameters.

Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.

The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus, is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion, the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all present experiments.

The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of c(exp[-beta*D]-1) \u003c v \u003c 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have length contraction effect.

Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on cool star and planet formation may be most significant in embedded clusters, where hundreds to thousands of cool stars form in close proximity to OB stars. At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have organized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment of the Sun?

Stellar parameters are determined using an automated fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the genetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be ~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs and giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly (or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and comparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good agreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 \u003c log L/L(sun) \u003c 6.1.

We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification. However, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The calculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed profiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...

Since the original publication of Stephen Hawking's {\\it A Brief History of Time} in 1988, the answers to these questions have progressed as a result of research by the community of active theoretical physicists including myself. To present the underlying ideas requires discussion of a wide range of topics in cosmology, especially the make up of the energy content of the universe.

To understand the reasoning leading to my conclusions could encourage reading of my entire book. My hope in writing this, my first popular book, is that it will engender reflection about time.

In the present paper we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.

In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$, real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator $\\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\\Delta_Q$ that are constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory.

Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al.

Those benefits include, but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality, and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of agile practices can and should be introduced.

Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the observations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5 mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.   The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are detected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and negative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is discussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.

The non-linearities appear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using techniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the one-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on the two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate quantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these results, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the process {u(t,x)}_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_+, x \\in [0,1]}, in terms of respectively Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to show that points are polar when d \u003e6 and are not polar when d\u003c6.

This interesting result arises from an analysis employing the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit states. Recently, Mintert {\\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

As network protocols have become increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has become increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific language, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing constraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally, Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and RTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.

Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced in heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a phase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral collisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the constraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison allows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative comparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the Z1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of abnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat capacity).

Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

Since moving metadislocations in the xi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase transition from xi' to xi'_n.

The Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many Einstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of superstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain (infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of 11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding models. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the infinite dimensional coset space E_{10} / K(E_{10}), where K(E_{10}) is the maximal compact subgroup of E_{10}.

One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).   I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.   The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1. This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

Scattered light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \\Delta (F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \\Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed disk material.

We introduce a computational asymmetry function that measures the amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length asymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational asymmetry. We relate boolean circuits to words in a Thompson monoid, over a fixed generating set, in such a way that circuit size is equal to word-length. Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a Thompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs of certain Thompson monoids. We also show that the results of Razborov and others on monotone circuit complexity lead to exponential lower bounds on certain distortions.

We show how to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding images on topics that are of interest to the user.

The smoothed complexity of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.

The major goal of LDC related research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query complexity of such codes.   Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne numbers.   Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime factor p\u003em^\\gamma yields a family of k(\\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \\epsilon \u003e 0 one can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length Exp(n^\\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger than known currently.

The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic anomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from the thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling through them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more explicit convenient for applications form.

However, not all field galaxies are young: studies of the colors, line strengths, and M/L ratios of massive early-type galaxies at 0\u003cz\u003c1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about their surroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment. There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer in the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already old galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy formation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in the most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with their environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory. Intriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-density relation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where both surveys become highly incomplete.

Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use, and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options market established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for which there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures in the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a confined system defined by the quantum numbers of the nucleon in the constituent quark model. The orbital structure functions for antiquarks can also be specified within the basic framework of this approach while the normalization of the gluon orbital structure function requires some additional assumptions.

The in-contact central film thickness and traction were entirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers using simple calculations.

This large mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e. fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above conditions.

In this current work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst conditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm) yielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3 support enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window for the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O increased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT growth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly enhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst nanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also be discussed.  Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to J. Nanosci.

The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200 $\\pm$ 40 J m\u0026#8722;2 s\u0026#8722;0.5 K\u0026#8722;1. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(\u0026#8722;1) dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt asteroids.

It also investigates a relation between the combinatorics of Young-Fibonacci tableaux and the study of Okada's algebra associated to the Young-Fibonacci lattice. The original algorithm was introduced by Roby and we redefine it in such a way that both the insertion and recording tableaux of any permutation are \\emph{conveniently} interpreted as chains in the Young-Fibonacci lattice. A property of Killpatrick's evacuation is given a simpler proof, but this evacuation is no longer needed in making Roby's and Fomin's constructions coincide. We provide the set of Young-Fibonacci tableaux of size $n$ with a structure of graded poset, induced by the weak order on permutations of the symmetric group, and realized by transitive closure of elementary transformations on tableaux. We show that this poset gives a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients in the transition matrix from the analogue of complete symmetric functions to analogue of the Schur functions in Okada's algebra. We end with a quite similar observation for four posets on Young-tableaux studied by Taskin.

The well know flattening of the Euclidean-normalised 1.4 GHz source counts below ~2 mJy, usually explained by a population of starburst galaxies undergoing luminosity evolution, is seen at 610 MHz. The 610 MHz source counts can be modelled by the same populations that explain the 1.4 GHz source counts, assuming a spectral index of -0.7 for the starburst galaxies and the steep spectrum AGN population. We find a similar dependence of luminosity evolution on redshift for the starburst galaxies at 610 MHz as is found at 1.4 GHz (i.e. 'Q'= 2.45 (+0.3,-0.4)).  Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

The apparatus produces 87-Rb BECs in a dual-chamber vacuum system that incorporates magnetic transport of trapped atoms from the magneto-optical trapping cell to the BEC production cell via the operation of a series of overlapping magnet coils. The design, construction, and operation of the apparatus are described in detail. The apparatus is used to study the creation of quantized vortices in BECs by the merging and interference of multiple trapped condensates. In this experiment, a single harmonic potential well is partitioned into three sections by an optical barrier, enabling the simultaneous formation of three independent, uncorrelated BECs. The BECs may either merge together during their growth, or, for high-energy barriers, the BECs can be merged together by barrier removal after their formation. Either process may instigate vortex formation in the resulting BEC, depending on the initially indeterminate relative phases of the condensates and the merging rate.

Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectral orders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed images are combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\\lambda) spectral data space and conventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyed during image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in some observing regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or scanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a combination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear approximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, has been used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34 nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently being used to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solar corona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm. In this paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of noise in the line shift signal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis to estimate the noise level and measurement precision in a high resolution solar magnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare those estimates to a test observation made in 2003, and discuss implications for future instruments.

Within the weak disorder limit and using a simple parabolic approximation for the valence band we show that Coulomb and exchange scattering contributions to the resistivity in GaMnAs are of the same order of magnitude. The positional correlations of defects result in a significant increase of Coulomb scattering, while the suppression of localized spin fluctuations in the ferromagnetic phase contributes substantially to the experimentally observed drop of resistivity below T_c.

Usually, if a finite element solution to a Poisson equation based on a triangulation of the underlying domain is not accurate enough, one will discard the solution and then refine the triangulation uniformly and compute a new finite element solution over the refined triangulation. It is wasteful to discard the original finite element solution. We propose a prewavelet method to save the original solution by adding a prewavelet subsolution to obtain the refined level finite element solution. To increase the accuracy of numerical solution to Poisson equations, we can keep adding prewavelet subsolutions.   Our prewavelets are orthogonal in the $H^1$ norm and they are compactly supported except for one globally supported basis function in a rectangular domain. We have implemented these prewavelet basis functions in MATLAB and used them for numerical solution of Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our prewavelet solution is much more efficient than the standard finite element method.

Recent experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for coarsening kinetics.

Materials and methods: We have used microplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of individual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic equation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different clones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed distributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model assuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive cell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes, we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed distributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were rendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal growth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of mitochondria.

We are focused upon effects due to the center-of-mass and short-range nucleon correlations embedded in translationally invariant ground-state wavefunctions. The latter are constructed in the so-called fixed center-of-mass approximation, starting with a Slater determinant wave function modified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how one can simplify evaluation of the corresponding expectation values that determine the distributions. The analytic expressions derived here involve the own \"Tassie-Barker\" factors for each distribution. As an illustration, numerical calculations have been carried out for the nucleus ^{4}He with the Slater determinant to describe the nucleon (1s)^4 configuration composed of single-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small distances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between nucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the center--of--mass corrected density and momentum distributions compared to the purely (1s)^4 shell nontranslationally invariant ones.

In 2d we establish precise connection, or covariance, with 2d critical-wetting and wedge-filling transitions, i.e. we establish that certain interfacial properties in very different geometries are identical.

In particular a specialization to the finite type case of the canonicla Wick rotation-rescaling theory, previously developed by the authors, is provided. This includes, for arbitrary curvatures, parameterizations in terms of suitable measured geodesic laminations on open hyperbolic surfaces of finite type. The same geometric objects also parameterize complex projective structures on the surfaces. The coincidence of such parameter space is explained by means of geometric correlations between spacetimes of different curvatures and projective surfaces realized via canonical WR-rescaling along the cosmological times. We also specialize on AdS case mostly referring to recent results achieved by other authors. In particular we describe maximal causal extensions of AdS globally hyperbolic spacetimes and an AdS approach to the theory of earthquakes for hyperbolic surfaces of finite type.

One proposed solution to this atmospheric effect is to observe simultaneously at two separate frequency bands of 230 and 690 GHz. Although the phase fluctuations have a smaller magnitude at the lower frequency, they can be measured more accurately and on shorter timescales due to the greater sensitivity of the array to celestial point source calibrators at this frequency. In theory, we can measure the atmospheric phase fluctuations in the 230 GHz band, scale them appropriately with frequency, and apply them to the data in 690 band during the post-observation calibration process. The ultimate limit to this atmospheric phase calibration scheme will be set by the instrumental phase stability of the IF and LO systems. We describe the methodology and initial results of the phase stability characterization of the IF and LO systems.

Due to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\\sl blocked configurations} which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the hyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be decomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy and Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the hydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One and Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We show that, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one, the macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time scaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result for more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding jumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove the degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in order not to change the macroscopic behavior.

Our formalism, which is described in some detail, relies on a nonadiabatic generalization of the traditional approximation. Numerical results are presented for a number of unstable modes in a model of SPB star, at rotation rates up to 250 km/s. It is shown that rotation has a large effect on mode visibility in light and in mean radial velocity variations. In most cases, fast rotation impairs mode detectability of g-modes in light variation, as Townsend (2003b) has already noted, but it helps detection in radial velocity variation. The mixed modes, which exist only at sufficiently fast rotation, are also more easily seen in radial velocity. The amplitude ratios and phase differences are strongly dependent on the aspect, the rotational velocity and on the mode. The latter dependence is essential for mode identification.

Deep Chandra observations revealed that the AGNs source surface density rises near clusters of galaxies. The natural extension of these works is the measurement of spatial clustering of AGNs around clusters and the investigation of relative biasing between active galactic nuclei and galaxies near clusters.The major aims of this work are to obtain a measurement of the correlation length of AGNs around clusters and a measure of the averaged clustering properties of a complete sample of AGNs in dense environments. We present the first measurement of the soft X-ray cluster-AGN cross-correlation function in redshift space using the data of the ROSAT-NEP survey. The survey covers 9x9 deg^2 around the North Ecliptic Pole where 442 X-ray sources were detected and almost completely spectroscopically identified. We detected a \u003e3sigma significant clustering signal on scales s\u003c50 h70^-1 Mpc. We performed a classical maximum-likelihood power-law fit to the data and obtained a correlation length s_0=8.7+1.2-0.3 h_70-1 Mpc and a slope gamma=1.7$^+0.2_-0.7 (1sigma errors). This is a strong evidence that AGNs are good tracers of the large scale structure of the Universe. Our data were compared to the results obtained by cross-correlating X-ray clusters and galaxies. We observe, with a large uncertainty, that the bias factor of AGN is similar to that of galaxies.

Using a maximum likelihood algorithm we detected a total of 1390 sources at least in one band. Using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the sky coverage we produced the logN-logS relations. These relations have been then derived in the 0.5--2 keV, 2--10 keV and 5--10 keV energy bands, down to flux limits of 7.2x10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, 4.0x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 and 9.7x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, respectively.

Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably ``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.

The cylinders must be covered with plates which introduce additional end-effects which alter the flow and make it more difficult to clearly distinguish between MRI stable and unstable state.

It encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay (IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support (compact or infinite).

More SWIFT events are needed to check this claim. We also report a new study with KONUS data of the VSB sample with an average energy above 90 keV showing a clear excess of events below 100 ms duration (T90) that have large mean energy protons. We suggest that VSB themselves consist of two subclasses: a fraction of events have peculiar distribution properties and have no detectable counterparts, as might be expected for exotic sources such as primordial black holes.

The properties we uncover include the presence of two representative conformations of the complex, the stabilization of one conformation by DNA architectural proteins, and precise values of the underlying twisting elastic constants and bending free energies. Incorporation of all this molecular information into gene-regulation models reveals an unprecedented versatility of looped DNA-protein complexes at shaping the properties of gene expression.

These asymmetries or line shifts are caused predominantly by vertical mass motions in flaring layers and they provide a good diagnostics for plasma flows during solar flares. There are many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of plasma flows in solar chromospheric flares. The main difficulty is the interpretation of line shifts or asymmetries. For many years, methods based on bisector techniques were used but they give a reliable results only for some specific conditions and in most cases cannot be applied. The most promising approach is to use the non-LTE techniques applied for flaring atmosphere. The calculation of synthetic line profiles is performed with the radiative transfer techniques and the assumed physical conditions correspond to flaring atmosphere. I will present an overview of different observations and interpretations of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares. I will explain what we have learnt about the chromospheric evaporation in the frame of hydrodynamical models as well as reconnection models. A critical review will be done on the classical methods used to derive Doppler-shifts for optically thick chomospheric lines. In particular, details on the new approach for interpreting chromospheric line asymmetries based on the non-LTE techniques will be presented.

But in contrast to exterior forms, which describe conservation laws for physical fields, the evolutionary forms correspond to conservation laws for material systems.   The evolutionary forms possess an unique peculiarity, namely, the closed exterior forms are obtained from these forms.

In this region there is not sufficient sunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals feed. Therefore the latitude of this region was lower before the end of the Pleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive object, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work and solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around the Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold and warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The cloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were deposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a close encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching deformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to several years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole moved from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. The massive object was torn to pieces, which evaporated.

The calculations of SHG susceptibility tensor are completed at finite frequencies and the static limit. The comparison with the experiments is also incorporated.

To do this we consider a model system that consists of a SMM embedded in the nonmagnetic barrier of a magnetic tunnel junction. The anisotropy axis of the SMM forms an arbitrary angle with magnetic moments of the leads (the latter ones are assumed to be collinear). The reversal of the SMM's spin takes place due to exchange interaction between the molecule and electrons tunneling through the barrier. The current flowing through the system as well as the average z-component of the SMM's spin are calculated in the second-order perturbation description (Fermi golden rule).

Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be determined by their representation theoretical properties.   Suppose that a finite group $Q$ acts on an abelian group $A$ so that there exists a bijective 1-cocycle $\\pi\\in Z^1(Q,\\ach)$, where $\\ach=\\rm{Hom}(A,\\C^*)$ is endowed with the diagonal $Q$-action.

In this paper we present a more general correspondence between bijective and non-degenerate cohomology classes.

The suggected method is fundamentally dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface. In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.   The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount. Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (\u003e30 or more atm.) and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any common electric plant of equivalent output.

It is a key ingredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In their seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it cycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting for cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem, mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre which shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result also holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.   On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually solved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets (left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right normal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search problem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think that even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small right-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case of rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of a given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the isomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the same is true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups and Artin-Tits groups of spherical type.

While the number of subhalos depends weakly on the formation time, the slope of the halo substructure velocity function does not. The satellite population within Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos is self-similar at scales between galaxies and galaxy clusters regardless of mass, whereas current observations show a break in self-similarity at a mass scale corresponding to group of galaxies.

Second we show that, for a generically stable family of bundles over a K\\\"ahler manifold, the Petersson-Weil form extends as a closed positive current on the whole parameter space of the family.

Our approach considers all possible scenarios for the set of species that will be extant at some future time, and weights them according to their likelihood under an independent (but not identical) distribution on species extinctions. Although the number of extinction scenarios can typically be very large, we show that there is a simple algorithm that will quickly compute this index.

The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation behind the strut-and-tie modeling.

Based on the fact that for isotropic materials the elastic trial stress and the projected plastic stress states have the same eigenvec-tors, the loading surface is formulated in the principal stress space rather than using the invariants of stress tensor. The model assumes that the directions of orthotropic damage coincide with principal directions of elastic predictor stress state (motivated by coaxial rotated crack model). Due to this assumption, the load-ing surface and the closest point projection algorithm can still be formulated in the principal directions. The evolution of the inelastic strain is determined using minimization principle. Damage and plastic parts of the inelastic strain are separated using a scalar parameter, which is assumed to be stress dependent. The paper also discusses an effective numerical implementation.

This eliminates the difficulty of a proper definition of equivalent strain which serves as a driving force for evolution of damage in concrete. Moreover, if eigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the stress tensor for the formulation of loading surface. In the present model the loading surface is represented in the polynomial form. This has two advantages: (i) it automatically fulfils C1 continuity and (ii) plane stress formulation is achieved by simply setting the third stress to zero. The perform-ance of the model is illustrated on example of a mixed-mode fracture of concrete. It is shown that for the pre-sent example the model prediction strongly depends on the choice of the stress degradation law.

Despite their importance, a comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR atmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 -- 1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe 2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some core-collapse SNe.

The continuous decrease of the out-of-plane lattice parameter with increasing temperature in the investigated range, indicates that PbTiO3 is still ferroelectric at the growth temperature (Tg= 600oC), which agrees with the theoretical prediction of TC= 765oC (compared to TCbulk= 490oC) for the present mismatch strain values.

It turns out that the structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for L-alanine in water as compared to crystal.

The evolution is by independent updating of the underlying Bernoulli variables indexed by discrete space-time that define the discrete web at any fixed s. In this paper, we study the existence of exceptional (random) values of s where the paths of the web do not behave like usual random walks and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of such exceptional s. Our results are motivated by those about exceptional times for dynamical percolation in high dimension by H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif, and in dimension two by Schramm and Steif. The exceptional behavior of the walks in DDW is rather different from the situation for dynamical random walks of Benjamini, H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif. In particular, we prove that there are exceptional values of s for which the walk from the origin S^s(n) has limsup S^s(n)/\\sqrt n \\leq K with a nontrivial dependence of the Hausdorff dimension on K. We also discuss how these and other results extend to the dynamical Brownian web, a natural scaling limit of DDW.

In order to obtain the observed cosmic ray spectrum it is necessary to take into account the diffusive losses in the Galaxy (which are making the energy spectrum more steeper). Another modification of the source spectrum is due to the fragmentation (spallation) of the cosmic ray particles, after their collision with the ISM atoms.

The connection between the group parameter and the Hubble constant H0 is established. It is shown that the existence of an anomalous blue-shifted frequency drift is a pure kinematic manifestation of the time inhomogeneity induced by the Universe expansion. This conclusion is confirmed via a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronization procedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordance with the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift is universal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, in principle, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions. The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession--intergalactic distance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z valid in the whole range of its variation. In the small z limit this expression exactly reproduces the Hubble law. The maximum value of this function at z=0.475 quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally found value z(exp) = 0.46 +/- 0.13 of the transition from the decelerated to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

Here, using calculations of ground states of suitable perturbed systems, droplets are obtained in two-dimensional +-J spin glasses, which are in the focus of a currently very lifely debate. Since a sophisticated matching algorithm is applied here, exact ground states of large systems up to L^2=256^2 spins can be generated. Furthermore, no equilibration or extrapolation to T=0 is necessary. Three different +-J models are studied here: a) with open boundary conditions, b) with fixed boundary conditions and c) a diluted system where a fraction p=0.125 of all bonds is zero. For large systems, the droplet energy shows for all three models a power-law behavior E_D L^\\theta'_D with \\theta'_D\u003c0.

The abrupt variations reported ranged 0.2 to 1.1 magnitudes, on time-scales between 2 to 100 hours, with a preponderance found nearer Mira minimum light phases.

Spectroscopically measured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show two distinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group with radial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity group exhibiting radial expansion velocities below ~250 km/s. We interpret the high-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knots as shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss. The chemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. The high velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher [N II]/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggesting greater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM. These results are compared with evidence for pre-SN mass loss in the Crab Nebula, perhaps the SNR most similar to 3C 58.

Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of their timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly available record of how information and influence spreads through an underlying social network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed graph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in blogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network. Not only are blogs interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.   Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and information propagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets, with 45,000 blogs and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings.

We detected luminous HCN(1--0) emissions toward a considerable fraction of these Seyfert galaxies (10 of 12 in our sub-sample), which indicated that some of these Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC 3079, NGC 3227, NGC 4051, NGC 6764, and NGC 7479, are indeed accompanied with compact nuclear starburst, given the tight correlation between the HCN(1--0) luminosity and the star formation rate among star-forming galaxies. However, we suggest that the elevated HCN(1--0) emission from some of these Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, NGC 1097, NGC 5033, and NGC 5194, does not signify the presence of massive starbursts there. This is because these Seyfert nuclei show abnormally high HCN(1--0)/HCO$^+$(1--0) ratios (2--3), which were never observed in the starburst nuclei in our sample. This could be attributed to the overabundance of HCN molecules in the X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) at the centers of these Seyfert galaxies.

More than 200 exoplanets have been found, including some around pulsars that we do not discuss here.   My physical definition for a planet is a roughly spherical, self-gravitating body more massive than 10**26 g formed from the leftover material in a protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because of agglomeration.   Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field, spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are inconsistent with the parameters for planets.

More precisely, the degree of integration of a minority in terms of the frequency of intermarriage is seen to crucially depend upon the the proportion p of the minority. Thus, a population may have a segregative behavior with respect to a high-p (p\u003e20%) minority A and at the same time a tolerant attitude toward a low-p (p\u003c2%) minority B. This remains true even when A and B represent the same minority; for instance Black-White intermarriage is much more frequent in Montana than it is in South Carolina.

The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation: it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for such flows.   Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought from any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned position by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by changing the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other preassigned vortex manifold.

Investigations of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem associated with such Hamiltonians have shown that in many cases the entire energy spectrum is real and positive and that the eigenfunctions form an orthogonal and complete basis. Furthermore, the quantum theories determined by such Hamiltonians have been shown to be consistent in the sense that the probabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary. However, the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in terms of such Hamiltonians have hitherto not been fully understood. This paper studies in detail the geometric properties of a Hilbert space endowed with a parity structure and analyses the characteristics of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian and its eigenstates. A canonical relationship between a PT-symmetric operator and a Hermitian operator is established. It is shown that the quadratic form corresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a natural partition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states having positive and negative PT norm. The indefiniteness of the norm can be circumvented by introducing a symmetry operator C that defines a positive definite inner product by means of a CPT conjugation operation.

Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.

Calculating results show that band gap in the majority spin band structure and band gap in the minority spin band structure were found to be 2.7012 eV and 0.6867 eV respectively.

Moreover, the up-spin Fe eg and down-spin Fe t2g were partially occupied near the Fermi energy, leading to a finite density of states. The Fe4+-O-Fe4+ plane superexchange coupling should rearrange the magnetic order to make the ferromagnetic characteristic being possible, moreover the tetragonal displacement along the c axis could induce the perovskites materials to acquire ferroelectric property. These reasons could lead to the fact that the tetragonal phase BFO could be a potential multiferroics while it was produced under the very experimental conditions. The charge density along different crystalline planes were illustrated to show that strong covalent bonding between O and Fe can be used to investigate the exchange coupling, and this strong hybridization may further increase the superexchange coupling to enhance the magnetic ordering.

CCAT observations will address fundamental themes in contemporary astronomy, notably the formation and evolution of galaxies, the nature of the dark matter and dark energy that comprise most of the content of the universe, the formation of stars and planets, the conditions in circumstellar disks, and the conditions during the early history of the Solar system. The candidate CCAT site, at 5600 m in northern Chile, enjoys superb observing conditions. To accommodate large format bolometer cameras, CCAT is designed with a 20 arcmin field of view. CCAT will incorporate closed loop active control of its segmented primary mirror to maintain a half wavefront error of 10 mum rms or less. Instrumentation under consideration includes both short (650 mum-200 mum) and long (2 mm-750 mum) wavelength bolometer cameras, direct detection spectrometers, and heterodyne receiver arrays. The University of Colorado, a Canadian university consortium, and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre on behalf of the UK community are pursuing participation in the CCAT consortium.

For example, a one Solar-mass (M_Sun) star would be pulled by roughly 1 mas by a one Jupiter-mass (M_J) planet with a period of one-hundred years at a distance of 20 pc. Such position accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based and space-based telescopes. The difficulty was that it often takes many decades before a detectable position shift will occur. However, by the time the next generation of astrometric missions such as SIM will be taking data, several decades will have past since the first astrometric mission, HIPPARCOS. Here we propose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurate SIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Using position errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection and characterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500) years for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby stars can be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may be quite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets with long-period orbits. Such a data set would nicely complement the short-period systems found by the radial-velocity method. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar companions can be found and characterized if their periods are shorter than about 500 years. This data set will provide invaluable constraints on models of planet formation, as well as a database for systems where the location of the giant planets allow for the formation of low-mass planets in the habitable zone.

Our results clearly show that the dissipational component is responsible for repeatedly deflecting orbits which visit often the center of the system. Moreover the gravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of the baryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremely chaotic. This randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. When this effect takes place for a significant number of orbits it will be manifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounder configuration. As a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shape of the phase space decreases with increasing distance from the center. We discuss the importance of future analysis of controlled experiments (i.e. using analytic potentials instead of live DM halos) to better decipher the dynamics of this phenomenon.

Local strings are characterized by having an energy momentum tensor whose only non null components are $T_{tt} = T_{zz}$ . As linearized Einstein equations are formally analogous to the Maxwell equations, the exterior solution does not depend on the radial distribution of the source and hence a Dirac d function was used to approximate the radial distribution of the energy momentum tensor for a local cosmic string along the z-axis: $T_{ab} = \\delta(x) \\delta(y)diag (\\sigma, 0, 0, \\sigma) $, $\\sigma $being the energy density of the string [A.Vilenkin.

This is done by taking into account Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory allows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term to Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous quantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs to a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. We emphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced in Casimir effect, just on general arguments thus it is independent on an explicit form of the energy-momentum dispersion relation.

The present state of knowledge about stellar winds, based on papers presented at this workshop, is described. About ten years ago the mechanisms of the winds were reasonably well understood, the mass loss rates were known, and the predictions of stellar evolution theory with mass loss agreed with observations. However, recent studies especially those based on FUSE observations, have resulted in a significant reduction of the mass loss rates, that disagrees with predictions from radiation driven wind models. The situation is discussed and future studies that can clarify the situation are suggested.   I also discuss what is known about the dissolution of star clusters in different environments. The dissolution time can be derived from the mass and age distributions of cluster samples. The resulting dissolution times of clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter than predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field. Encounters with giant molecular clouds can explain the fate of clusters in the SN and are the most likely cause of the short lifetime of clusters in interacting galaxies.

It implies quark confinement (the quark propagator has no pole, indeed), as well as the dynamical breakdown of chiral symmetry (a chiral symmetry preserving solution is forbidded). This system can be solved exactly in the chiral limit. We have established the space of the smooth test functions (consisting of the Green's functions for the quark propagator and the corresponding quark-gluon vertex) in which our generalized function (the confining gluon propagator) becomes a continuous linear functional. It is a linear topological space $K(c)$ of the infinitely differentiable functions (with respect to the dimensionless momentum variable $x$), having compact support in the region $x \\leq c$. We develop an analytical formalism, the so-called chiral perturbtion theory at the fundamental quark level, which allows one to find explicit solution for the quark propagator in powers of the light quark masses. We also develop an analytical formalism, which allows one to find the solution for the quark propagator in the inverse powers of the heavy quark masses. It justifies the use for the heavy quark propagator its free counterpart up to terms of the order $1/m_Q^3$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. So this solution automatically possesses the heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry.

An intracomparison of aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e. coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate, the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for nitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.

In this review, we emphasize two mechanisms which have been proposed to explain this result: production of a single light neutral spin-zero particle or pair production of light minicharged particles. We discuss a class of models, involving, in addition to our familiar ``visible'' photon, further light ``hidden paraphotons'', which mix kinematically with the visible one, and further light paracharged particles. In these models, very strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly interacting light particles mentioned above can be evaded. In the upcoming year, a number of decisive laboratory based tests of the particle interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly will be done. More generally, such experiments, exploiting high fluxes of low-energy photons and/or large electromagnetic fields, will dig into previously unconstrained parameter space of the above mentioned models.

As a consequence the properties of the sub-millimetre sky as a whole, and of rare bright objects in particular, remains largely unknown. Here we describe a forthcoming survey (the SCUBA-2 ``All-Sky'' Survey, or SASSy) designed to address this issue by making a large-area map of approximately one-fifth of the sky visible from the JCMT (4800 square degrees) down to a 1 sigma noise level of 30 mJy/beam. This map forms the pilot for a much larger survey, which will potentially map the remaining sky visible from the JCMT, with the region also visible to ALMA as a priority. SASSy has been awarded 500 hours for the 4800 square degree pilot phase and will commence after the commissioning of SCUBA-2, expected in early 2008.  Comment: 26 pages, 5 figures.

The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy. Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the elementary particles.

In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and self-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating functions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in biological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of Markov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a memoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of automata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of problems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings. The applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of automata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords (including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a general text.

However, while n-dimensional spaces in applications are always realized as the Euclidean space R^n, Hilbert spaces admit various useful realizations as spaces of functions. In the paper this simple observation is used to construct a fruitful formalism of local coordinates on Hilbert manifolds. Images of charts on manifolds in the formalism are allowed to belong to arbitrary Hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions.

The case of covers of the projective line branched only over the points 0, 1, and infinity, through Belyi's theorem, leads to Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants program for understanding the absolute Galois group through its faithful action on such covers. This note is motivated by Catanese's question about a higher-dimensional analogue: does the absolute Galois group act faithfully on the deformation equivalence classes of smooth surfaces? (These equivalence classes are of course by definition the strongest deformation invariants.) We give a short proof of a weaker result: the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth surfaces (of general type, canonically polarized).

At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support.

In peripheral nerve, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) creates a 30 kDa fragment of beta-dystroglycan, leading to a disruption of the link between the extracellular matrix and the cell membrane. Here we asked if the processing of the beta-dystroglycan could influence the anchorage of Dp116 or/and utrophin in normal and mdx Schwann cell membrane. We showed that MMP-9 was more activated in mdx nerve than in wild-type one. This activation leads to an accumulation of the 30 kDa beta-dystroglycan isoform and have an impact on the anchorage of Dp116 and utrophin isoforms in mdx Schwann cells membrane. Our results showed that Dp116 had greater affinity to the full length form of beta-dystroglycan than the 30 kDa form. Moreover, we showed for the first time that the short isoform of utrophin (Up71) was over-expressed in mdx Schwann cells compared to wild-type. In addition, this utrophin isoform (Up71) seems to have greater affinity to the 30 kDa beta-dystroglycan which could explain a more stabilization of this 30 kDa at the membrane compartment.

As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the early universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid, with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and the large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5$\\sigma$ confidence level, but also favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2. If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at $2\\sigma$. In contrast, Planck alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the $4.2\\sigma$ confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to $\\Delta N_\\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\\sigma$ errors). We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector. This sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capable of probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space. Planck may also be sensitive to a scale of neutrino mass generation as high as 1 TeV.

Residual correlations between photons from pion decays are considered as a new possible source of information on direct photon fraction. Residual correlations in $p\\gamma$ and $p\\Lambda$ systems due to $p\\Sigma^0$ interaction in final state are predicted based on the $p\\Sigma^0$ low energy scattering parameters deduced from the spin-flavour SU$_6$ model by Fujiwara et al. including effective meson exchange potentials and explicit flavour symmetry breaking to reproduce the properties of the two-nucleon system and the low-energy hyperon-nucleon cross section data. The $p\\gamma_{\\Sigma^0}$ residual correlation is concentrated at $k^* \\approx 70$ Mev/$c$ and its shape and intensity appears to be sensitive to the scattering parameters and space-time dimensions of the source. The $p\\Lambda_{\\Sigma^0}$ residual correlation recovers the negative parent $p\\Sigma^0$ correlation for $k^* \u003e 70$ Mev/$c$. The neglect of this negative residual correlation would lead to the underestimation of the parent $p\\Lambda$ correlation effect and to an overestimation of the source size.

In addition we correct the formula for the redshift of sound signals from our original work. We show that, if there exists a special kind of Born-Infeld type scalar field, then one can send information from inside a black hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field propagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a \"new ether\". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the non-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the superluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this \"new ether\". We found the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of the scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small perturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the Schwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole. Thus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose horizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.

It will use interferometric and pulse ranging techniques between the spacecraft and ground stations, to make high precision measurements of the parameters that describe the solar system, and to test relativistic gravity with improved accuracy. At the heart of the spacecraft is a test mass, which the spacecraft will follow using a drag-free control system. The mission critically depends on maintaining the geodesic motion of the test mass. Charging of the test mass due to cosmic rays and solar particles will disturb its geodesic motion. We have modelled the charging process using the GEANT4 toolkit and a simplified, geometrical model and estimate that the ASTROD I test mass will charge positively, at a rate of 24 +/-7 e+/s, due to cosmic ray protons and alpha particles (3He and 4He) at solar minimum. We have used the results of this simulation to estimate the magnitude of disturbances associated with test mass charging, for the worst-case scenario, taking into account uncertainties in the model and potential charging contributions from minor cosmic-ray components.

Since ASTROD will be after LISA, in the Cosmic Vision time-frame 2015-2025, a ten-fold improvement over LISA accelerometer noise goal would be possible, allowing us to test relativistic gravity to 1 ppb and improve the gravitational-wave sensitivity.

An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of computer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the sensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the cutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in pressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue. Obtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first results are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests.

We review the main mathematical properties of multiply connected spaces, and the different tools to classify them and to analyse their properties. Following their mathematical classification, we describe the different possible muticonnected spaces which may be used to construct Friedmann-Lemaitre universe models. Observational tests concern the distribution of images of discrete cosmic objects or more global effects, mainly those concerning the Cosmic Microwave Background. According to the 2003-2006 WMAP data releases, various deviations from the flat infinite universe model predictions hint at a possible non-trivial topology for the shape of space. In particular, a finite universe with the topology of the Poincar\\'e dodecahedral spherical space fits remarkably well the data and is a good candidate for explaining both the local curvature of space and the large angle anomalies in the temperature power spectrum. Such a model of a small universe, whose volume would represent only about 80% the volume of the observable universe, offers an observational signature in the form of a predictable topological lens effect on one hand, and rises new issues on the physics of the early universe on the other hand.

Three typical relaxation phenomena were detected, which all showed a separated temperature dependence of resistivity consistent with thermally activated charge transport. The dominating grain boundary and the interface contributions exhibited distinctively different capacitance allowing clear identification. The composite nature of the dielectric properties in polycrystalline functional ceramics was emphasized, and impedance spectroscopy was shown to be a powerful tool to account for and model such behaviour.

The prevailing methods such as Dodgson condensation, continued fraction expansion, LU decomposition, all produce product formulas when they are applicable. We mention the classic case of the Hankel determinants with binomial entries ${3k+2 \\choose k}$ and those with entries ${3k \\choose k}$; both of these classes of Hankel determinants have product form evaluations. The intermediate case, ${3k+1 \\choose k}$ has not been evaluated. There is a good reason for this: these latter determinants do not have product form evaluations.   In this paper we evaluate the Hankel determinant of ${3k+1 \\choose k}$. The evaluation is a sum of a small number of products, an almost product.   The method actually provides more, and as applications, we present the salient points for the evaluation of a number of other Hankel determinants with polynomial entries, along with product and almost product form evaluations at special points.

This arrangement has a complex constraint involving the sines of its angles. These constraints cannot be satisfied by any projection of the initial arrangement. This is sufficient to prove Pappus's theorem. The derivation of the constraint is via systems of inequalities arising from the polar coordinates of the lines. These systems are linear in r for any given theta, and their solubility can be analysed in terms of the signs of determinants. The evaluation of the determinants is via a normal form for sums of products of sines, giving a powerful system of trigonometric identities. The particular result is generalized to arrangements derived from three edge connected totally cyclic directed graphs, conjectured to be sufficient for a complete analysis of angle constraining arrangements of lines, and thus a full response to Ringel's slope conjecture.

In this paper we bound the degree of a minimal splitting field of this type from above and show that our bound is sharp in certain situations, even in the case where $L/F$ is a split extension. This gives in particular a number of generalizations of the classical fact that when the tensor product of two quaternion algebras is not a division algebra, the two quaternion algebras must share a common quadratic splitting field.   In another direction, our constructions combined with results of Karpenko also show that for any odd prime number $p$, the generic algebra of index $p^n$, and exponent $p$ cannot be expressed nontrivially as the corestriction of an algebra over any extension field if $n \u003c p^2$.

Conversely, if the approximation by products is good in this region, the zeta-function has at most finitely many zeros in it. We then construct a parameterized family of non-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of a finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family satisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large, they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are all simple, and they \"repel\". The structure of these functions makes the reason for the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a mechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the zeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions in the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for small values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them as the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function, the moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the zeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis. We end by discussing analogues for other L-functions and show how they give insight into the study of the distribution of zeros of linear combinations of L-functions.

This approach is based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions, or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior of the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and five-diagonal unitary matrices.   In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions. Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.   As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.

The sum rule in the I=1 channel is less reliable but also consistent with a small value for the overlap.

The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional space elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface without the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic mast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control load capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have the height of a geosynchronous orbit (36,000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up 120,000 - 160,000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons. 4.

This test mass charge will result in Coulomb forces between the test mass and the surrounding electrodes. In earlier work using the GEANT4 toolkit, we predicted a net charging rate of nearly 9.0 +e/s from cosmic-ray protons between 0.1 and 1000 GeV at solar maximum, and rising to 26.5 +e/s at solar minimum. Here we use GEANT4 to simulate the charging process due to solar energetic particle events and to estimate the magnitude of acceleration noise due to this charging. The predicted charging rates range from 2840 to 64300 +e/s, at peak intensity, for the 4 largest SEP events in September and October 1989. For the 2 larger events, the acceleration disturbances due to charging exceeds the ASTROD I acceleration noise budget requirement. Continuous discharge should be considered for suppressing this charging noise. The acceleration noise during the 2 small events is well below the design target, although during these events, the net charging rate will be dominated by these solar fluxes.

We give a simple but more general polynomial dynamic programming solution for the MRSO problem for associated implied structure graphs of bounded clique-width. Our result implies that MRSO is polynomial for graphs of bounded tree-width, co-graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, and distance hereditary graphs. Further we conclude that the problem of comparing two solutions for MRSO is hard for the class of problems which can be solved in polynomial time with a number of parallel queries to an oracle in NP.

On the other hand we explain that for a certain class of groups -- in particular hyperbolic groups -- these two properties are equivalent.

However, this has been the way these databases and associated optimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern. They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.

In this study we present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected, pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental rules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between the predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the poorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the organization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial constraints.

Due to the scale invariance of the background theory, the 4D effective theory contains a volume modulus. To stabilize the modulus, we consider one-loop corrections to the effective potential by the Casimir effect. The one-loop effective potential for the volume modulus has a form which is very similar to Coleman-Weinberg potential. We evaluate coefficients appearing in the effective potential by employing zeta function regularization and heat kernel analysis. The volume modulus is stabilized for smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit angle of the reference brane. After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible to obtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scales and a tiny effective cosmological constant (though its sign is negative). The degree of warping should be tuned to be close to the critical value, not as severely as the original fine-tuning.

Measuring the local concentration of such a protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively, position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers. As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single cell.

We use responses to a survey of people who have recovered lost websites, in combination with supplementary interviews, to paint a fuller picture of current curatorial strategies and practices. We examine the types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost and the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material. We further explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic backups, and unsystematic file replication.

Our aim is to design a service for the long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records. Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently. Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate, creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats; and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies; and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked storage.

Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiative transfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Herbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fully exploited. Here, we are interested in checking if these new observational imaging constraints can be accounted for by predictions based on existing models of passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disks made to fit the SEDs of the Herbig Ae stars.   Methods: The images taken by VISIR in the 8.6 and 11.3 microns aromatic features reveal a large flaring disk around HD97048 inclined to the line of sight. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of these data, we use a disk model which includes the most up to date understanding of disk structure and physics around Herbig Ae stars with grains in thermal equilibrium in addition to transiently-heated PAHs.   Results: We compare the observed spatial distribution of the PAH emission feature and the adjacent continuum emission with predictions based on existing full disk models. Both SED and spatial distribution are in very good agreement with the model predictions for common disk parameters.   Conclusions: We take the general agreement between observations and predictions as a strong support for the physical pictures underlying our flared disk model.

Its main goal is to discover general laws governing the creation and growth as well as processes taking place on networks, like e.g. the Internet, transportation or neural networks. It turned out that most real-world networks cannot be simply reduced to a compound of some individual components. Fortunately, the statistical mechanics, being one of pillars of modern physics, provides us with a very powerful set of tools and methods for describing and understanding these systems. In this thesis, we would like to present a consistent approach to complex networks based on statistical mechanics, with the central role played by the concept of statistical ensemble of networks. We show how to construct such a theory and present some practical problems where it can be applied. Among them, we pay attention to the problem of finite-size corrections and the dynamics of a simple model of mass transport on networks.

At the theoretical level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.  Comment: New abstract. Due to a mistake, abstract from V1 was from an old,   draft version of the work.

The RS consists of Frenet -Serret orthogonal tetrads where the rotating detector is at rest and has a constant acceleration vector. The CFs and the energy density at the rotating reference system should be periodic with rotation period because CF and energy density measurements is one of the tools the detector can use to justify the periodicity of its motion. The CFs have been calculated for both electromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without taking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic CFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the temperature T= h w /k . Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic and massless scalar field it is shown that the detector rotating in the zero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but, above that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial detector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T. This effect is masked by factor 2/3(4 gamma^2-1) for the electromagnetic field and 2/9 (4 gamma ^2-1) for the massless scalar field, where the Lorentz factor gamma=(1 - v^2 / c^2)^(1/2). Appearance of these masking factors is connected with the fact that rotation is defined by two parameters, angular velocity w and the radius of rotation, in contrast with a uniformly accelerated linear motion which is defined by only one parameter, acceleration a.

The processes--$\\epsilon$-machines as defined in computational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect, the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality, these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global complexity requires local simplicity.

The annular free flow model for $\\gamma$-ray emission of pulsars is suggested in this paper. It is emphasized that: (1). Two kinds of acceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. The annular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross the null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop in the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young pulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be accelerated and produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regions and stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential drop in the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. The annular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as observed. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models are retained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiao et al., which match the observations well. (5). Since charges with different signs leave the pulsar through the annular and the core regions, respectively, the current closure problem can be partially solved.

As a concrete demonstration, the positronium groundstate is considered in great detail; especially the groundstate energy $E_0$ is worked out in the non-relativistic approximation and under neglection of the magnetic interactions between the positron and the electron. The corresponding RST prediction $(E_0\\simeq -6,48 [eV])$ misses the analogous conventional Schr\\\"odinger result $(E_0\\simeq -6,80 [eV])$ but is closer to the latter than the corresponding Hartree approximation $(-2,65 [eV])$. The missing binding energy of $6,80-6,48=0,32 [eV]$ can be attributed to the approximative use of an SO(3) symmetric interaction potential which in RST, however, is actually only SO(2) invariant against rotations around the z-axis. It is expected that, with the correct use of an anisotropic interaction potential due to the SO(2) symmetry, the RST predictions will come even closer to the conventional Schr\\\"odinger result, where however the mathematical structure of RST relies on exotic (i.e. double-valued) wave functions and on the corresponding unconventional interaction potentials (e.g. Struve-Neumann potential).

These include (i) specific imaging of surface receptors using a pH sensitive fluorescent protein, (ii) design of a photoactivable drug to inactivate locally surface receptors and monitor electrophysiologically their recovery, and (iii)application of single molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly track the movement of individual surface receptors with nanometer resolution inside and outside synapses.

Most of these domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and proteins, and are believed to coordinate signal transduction cascades. Whether similar domains are also present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane is unclear so far. To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the diffusion of 30-40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical size of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.

Inside individual synapses, we found immobile and mobile receptors, which display restricted diffusion. Extra-synaptic receptors display free diffusion. Receptors could also exchange between these membrane compartments through lateral diffusion. Glutamate application increased both receptor mobility inside synapses and the fraction of mobile receptors present in a juxtasynaptic region. Block of inhibitory transmission to favor excitatory synaptic activity induced a transient increase in the fraction of mobile receptors and a decrease in the proportion of juxtasynaptic receptors.

In heavy-ion collisions, such processes occur as well, and due to a separation of scales are calculable on the level of the production of high p_T partons. These subsequently interact with the medium which originates from semi-hard and soft processes in the same collision before they hadronize. The presence of the medium thus modifies the momentum spectrum of outgoing partons and thus hard hadrons. The idea of jet tomography is to study this modification in order to learn about the medium density distribution. While this is a compelling idea, its practical application encounters some difficulties. In this paper, the capability of various observables to provide tomographic information about the medium is discussed and compared.

Using the first resource we get two disjoint classes of filiform Leibniz algebras. The present paper deals with the second of the above two classes, the first class has been considered in our previous paper. The algebraic classification here means to specify the representatives of the orbits, whereas the geometric classification is the problem of finding generic structural constants in the sense of algebraic geometry. Our main effort in this paper is the algebraic classification. We suggest here an algebraic method based on invariants. Utilizing this method for any given low dimensional case all filiform Leibniz algebras can be classified. Moreover, the results can be used for geometric classification of orbits of such algebras.

The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field. Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus (where shot noise vanishes), agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron heating.

This allows to describe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of Richardson's law for separation above viscous scale.

In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-line outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.

From an observational point of view this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code, NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation. For extragalactic clusters in M81 and M31 we looked at medium band spectral energy distributions and found for some clusters also a good agreement.

Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.   The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron fraction data yet available.

One of the most intriguing points is the observation of abnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which can exceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the filling factor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmission arises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission should disappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupled through the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise to the position of the apertures. This result can be modelled in the statistical framework of stochastic resonance. The evolution of the coupled energy with respect to noise gives access to the extra energy coupled at the surface of the subwavelength array.

The uranium is present in a poorly crystalline orthorhombic, alpha-U state.

Diffraction spectra indicate a high degree of crystallinity in both U and Gd layers with intensities consistent with the growth of a novel hcp U phase, stabilised by the hcp gadolinium layers.

The Universe is considered a closed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOs first ionized the IGM (5 \u003c= z_on \u003c= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas is calculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic to non-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used to determine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 \u003c= z \u003c= z_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at the present epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on are adjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overall agreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that the model of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in fact agrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. However, our model of the IGM cannot explain the observed cosmic x ray background.   This paper was originally written in 1990. It was never submitted for publication.

As part of the survey, we observed 54 objects total, of which 45 were close, young stars, 2 were somewhat more distant (\u003c150 pc), very young (\u003c10 Myr) stars, 3 were stars with known radial velocity planets, and 4 were older, very nearby (\u003c20 pc) solar analogues. Our SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filter to take images simultaneously at 3 wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 um methane absorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giant planets. In our VLT data, we achieved H band contrasts \u003e 10 mag (5 sigma) at a separation of 0.5\" from the primary star on 45% of our targets and H band contrasts of \u003e 9 mag at a separation of 0.5'' on 80% of our targets. With this degree of attenuation, we should be able to image (5sigma detection) a 5 M_{Jup} planet 15 AU from a 70 Myr K1 star at 15 pc or a 5 M_{Jup} planet at 2 AU from a 12 Myr M star at 10 pc. We believe that our SDI images are the highest contrast astronomical images ever made from ground or space for methane rich companions \u003c1'' from their star. For the best 20 of our survey stars, we attained 50% 5 sigma completeness for 6-10 M_Jup planets at semi-major axes of 20-40 AU.

From our survey null result, we can rule out (at the 98% confidence/2.0sigma level) a model planet population using a planet distribution where N(a) $\\propto$ constant out to a distance of 45 AU (further model assumptions discussed within).

We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the advanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no opportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation with an arbitrary complementary function. One then requires a plausible explanation for the observed broken symmetry that, commonly, is understood cannot be met by the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism because the necessary boundary condition cannot be satisfied in acceptable cosmologies. We take this opportunity to argue that the boundary condition is already met by all expanding cosmologies simply as a result of cosmological red-shift. A consequence is that the cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time can be equated, the direct action version of EM is preferred, and that advanced potentials are ubiquitous.

The proximity of the GC region makes it an ideal place to study the unusual processes that tend to manifest themselves in Galactic nuclei. This thesis uses single-dish and interferometric radio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, and mid-IR observations to study the wide variety of physical processes seen in the GC region on physical scales from 0.1 to 100 parsecs. These observations provide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission in the central 500 parsecs. I also study the properties of nonthermal radio filaments, which can constrain their origin and the structure of the magnetic field in the GC region.   The presence of massive star clusters and a massive black hole suggest that starburst and AGN phenomena can manifest themselves in our Galaxy. This thesis explores this possibility by studying a 150-pc-tall, shell-like structure called the Galactic center lobe (GCL). Our observations examine the spectral index, dust emission, polarized continuum emission, and ionized gas throughout the GCL. I find strong evidence supporting the idea that the GCL is a true three-dimensional shell located in the GC region with nested layers of ionized, magnetized, and mid-IR--emitting components. I compare the physical conditions of the GCL to proposed models for its origin and find best agreement with starburst outflows seen in other galaxies, yet consistent with the currently observed pressure and star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of our Galaxy.

The truly useful role of AltHistAstro-ph archive would be to match astronomers with unappreciated ideas with other astronomers with underutilized resources, hopefully leading in some cases to resurrection of old proposals and resulting publications in the regular astro-ph archive. Given the possible danger of a low signal-to-noise and possible confusion, a creation of a separate archive seems like a good idea, although it should be noted that low signal-to-noise is achieved on astro-ph quite often already. Finally, I include my own excellent, but rejected (twice), HST proposal, as an example of a potential AltHistAstro-ph posting.

This interference is a direct result of quantum exchange statistics, however, it is observed only in the joint probability to find the particles in two separated detectors. Here we report the first observation of such interference fringes between two independent and non-interacting electrons in an interferometer proposed by Yurke et al. and Samuelsson et al. Our experiment resembles the \"Hanbury Brown and Twiss\" (HBT) experiment, which was performed with classical waves. In the experiment, two independent and mutually incoherent electron beams were each partitioned into two trajectories. The combined four trajectories enclosed an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux (but not the two trajectories of a single electron). While individual currents were found to be independent of the AB flux, as expected, the cross-correlation between current fluctuations in two opposite points across the device exhibited strong AB oscillations. This is a direct signature of orbital entanglement between two electrons even though they never interact with each other.
